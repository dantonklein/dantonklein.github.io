This file controls your site's metadata, social links, theme settings, section visibility, and more.\r\n\r\n### Basic Information\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport const siteConfig: SiteConfig = {\r\n  name: \"Your Name\",\r\n  title: \"Your Title/Tagline\",\r\n  description: \"Brief description of your portfolio\",\r\n  avatar: \"../assets/your-avatar.png\",\r\n  location: \"Your City, Country\",\r\n  email: \"your@email.com\",\r\n  // ... more config\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Social Links\r\n\r\nAdd your social media profiles:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nsocialLinks: {\r\n  github: \"https://github.com/username\",\r\n  linkedin: \"https://linkedin.com/in/username\",\r\n  twitter: \"https://twitter.com/username\",\r\n  bluesky: \"https://bsky.app/profile/username\",\r\n  instagram: \"https://instagram.com/username\",\r\n  youTube: \"https://youtube.com/@username\",\r\n  codetips: \"https://codetips.cloud/u/username\",\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll fields are optional - only include the platforms you use.\r\n\r\n### Theme Settings\r\n\r\nChoose between theme selector (dropdown) or theme toggle (checkbox):\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nenableThemeSelector: true  // true = dropdown, false = checkbox\r\n```\r\n\r\nAvailable themes:\r\n- `light` - Clean light theme (default)\r\n- `dark` - Dark theme\r\n- `synthwave` - Retro cyberpunk\r\n- `retro` - Vintage computing\r\n- `valentine` - Warm pink tones\r\n- `dim` - Dimmed dark theme\r\n\r\n### Section Visibility\r\n\r\nControl which sections appear on your homepage:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nsections: {\r\n  about: true,      // About section\r\n  projects: true,   // Projects showcase\r\n  blog: true,       // Latest blog posts\r\n  work: true,       // Work experience\r\n  education: true,  // Education history\r\n  hackathons: true, // Hackathon participation\r\n  contact: true,    // Contact section\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSet any section to `false` to hide it.

This is only available in `.mdx` files (not `.md`).\r\n\r\n### When to Use MDX vs MD\r\n\r\n**Use `.md` when**:\r\n- Writing simple blog posts\r\n- No need for interactive components\r\n- Standard markdown is sufficient\r\n\r\n**Use `.mdx` when**:\r\n- Embedding media (Spotify, YouTube, Twitter)\r\n- Creating interactive content\r\n- Using custom components\r\n- Need advanced formatting\r\n\r\n### Importing Components\r\n\r\nAt the top of your `.mdx` file, import the components you need:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"My Post\"\r\ndescription: \"Post description\"\r\npublishDate: \"2024-01-27\"\r\n---\r\n\r\nimport Spotify from '../../components/Spotify.astro';\r\nimport YouTube from '../../components/YouTube.astro';\r\nimport Twitter from '../../components/Twitter.astro';\r\n\r\n# My Post Content\r\n\r\nRegular markdown content here...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Available Media Components\r\n\r\nBloomfolio includes three built-in media components for rich content:\r\n\r\n#### Spotify Component\r\n\r\nEmbed Spotify tracks, albums, playlists, or podcasts:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n\u003CSpotify url=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/...\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### YouTube Component\r\n\r\nEmbed YouTube videos using either ID or full URL:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n\u003CYouTube id=\"video-id\" />\r\n\u003C!-- OR -->\r\n\u003CYouTube url=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=...\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Twitter Component\r\n\r\nEmbed tweets using URL or ID:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n\u003CTwitter url=\"https://x.com/user/status/...\" />\r\n\u003C!-- OR -->\r\n\u003CTwitter id=\"tweet-id\" username=\"username\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Live Examples\r\n\r\nWant to see these components in action? Check out the **[Rich Media Embeds Example](/blog/embed-examples)** page which demonstrates all three media components with live examples.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Writing Best Practices\r\n\r\n### 1. Structure Your Content\r\n\r\n**Good Structure**:\r\n```markdown\r\n# Main Title\r\n\r\nIntroduction paragraph explaining what the post is about.\r\n\r\n## First Section\r\n\r\nContent for the first section...\r\n\r\n### Subsection\r\n\r\nMore detailed information...\r\n\r\n## Second Section\r\n\r\nContent for the second section...\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nSummary and next steps...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Use Meaningful Headings\r\n\r\n**Good**:\r\n- `## Installation Steps`\r\n- `## Common Errors and Solutions`\r\n- `## Performance Optimization`\r\n\r\n**Avoid**:\r\n- `## Part 1`\r\n- `## More Information`\r\n- `## Details`\r\n\r\n### 3. Break Up Long Paragraphs\r\n\r\nKeep paragraphs to 2-4 sentences for better readability:\r\n\r\n**Good**:\r\n```markdown\r\nMarkdown is easy to learn. It uses simple, intuitive syntax that mirrors\r\nhow people naturally format text in emails.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of Markdown is its readability. Even in raw form, it's easy\r\nto understand what the formatted output will look like.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Avoid**:\r\n```markdown\r\nMarkdown is easy to learn and it uses simple, intuitive syntax that mirrors how people naturally format text in emails and the beauty of Markdown is its readability because even in raw form, it's easy to understand what the formatted output will look like and it makes writing documentation much faster.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 4. Use Code Examples\r\n\r\nWhen explaining technical concepts, include code examples:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n## Using Array Methods\r\n\r\nThe `map()` method creates a new array:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\r\nconst doubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2);\r\nconsole.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 5. Include Visual Breaks\r\n\r\nUse horizontal rules, blockquotes, or images to break up long sections of text:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n## Long Topic\r\n\r\nFirst part of the content...\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSecond part of the content...\r\n\r\n> Important note: This is a key point to remember.\r\n\r\nFinal part of the content...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 6. Link to Related Content\r\n\r\nHelp readers discover more:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\nFor more information on setting up your portfolio, check out the\r\n[Complete Guide](/blog/guides/bloomfolio-complete-guide).\r\n\r\nLearn how to structure your content in the\r\n[Content Collections Guide](/blog/guides/content-collections-guide).\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## SEO Best Practices\r\n\r\n### Write Good Meta Descriptions\r\n\r\nYour frontmatter description is used for SEO:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n---\r\ndescription: \"Learn Markdown syntax and MDX features in Bloomfolio with this comprehensive guide.\"\r\n---\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Tips**:\r\n- Keep under 160 characters\r\n- Include primary keywords\r\n- Make it compelling\r\n- Describe what readers will learn\r\n\r\n### Use Descriptive Alt Text\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n![A comparison chart showing Markdown syntax on the left and rendered HTML on the right](./markdown-vs-html.png)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Structure with Headings\r\n\r\nSearch engines use headings to understand content structure. Use them logically:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n# Main Topic (H1 - only one per page)\r\n## Major Section (H2)\r\n### Subsection (H3)\r\n#### Minor Point (H4)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Internal Linking\r\n\r\nLink to other pages on your site:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\nCheck out my [E-commerce project](/projects/ecommerce-platform) for a\r\npractical example.\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Accessibility Tips\r\n\r\n### 1. Meaningful Link Text\r\n\r\n**Good**:\r\n```markdown\r\nLearn more about [Markdown syntax](https://example.com).\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Avoid**:\r\n```markdown\r\nLearn more [here](https://example.com).\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Image Alt Text\r\n\r\nDescribe the image content, not just what it is:\r\n\r\n**Good**:\r\n```markdown\r\n![Bar chart showing 50% improvement in page load times after optimization](./performance-chart.png)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Avoid**:\r\n```markdown\r\n![Chart](./performance-chart.png)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. Heading Hierarchy\r\n\r\nDon't skip heading levels:\r\n\r\n**Good**:\r\n```markdown\r\n# Title\r\n## Section\r\n### Subsection\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Avoid**:\r\n```markdown\r\n# Title\r\n### Subsection  \u003C!-- Skipped H2 -->\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\r\n\r\n### 1. Inconsistent Spacing\r\n\r\nMarkdown needs blank lines between elements:\r\n\r\n**Correct**:\r\n```markdown\r\n## Heading\r\n\r\nParagraph text here.\r\n\r\n- List item 1\r\n- List item 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Incorrect**:\r\n```markdown\r\n## Heading\r\nParagraph text here.\r\n- List item 1\r\n- List item 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Not Escaping Special Characters\r\n\r\nIf you need to display special characters literally, escape them with `\\`:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n\\*This text has literal asterisks\\*\r\n\\# This is not a heading\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. Mixing Markdown and HTML Unnecessarily\r\n\r\nWhile you can use HTML in Markdown, it's better to use Markdown syntax when possible:\r\n\r\n**Prefer**:\r\n```markdown\r\n**Bold text**\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Over**:\r\n```html\r\n\u003Cstrong>Bold text\u003C/strong>\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Markdown Cheat Sheet\r\n\r\nQuick reference for common syntax:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n# H1\r\n## H2\r\n### H3\r\n\r\n**bold**\r\n*italic*\r\n~~strikethrough~~\r\n`code`\r\n\r\n- Bullet list\r\n1. Numbered list\r\n\r\n[Link](url)\r\n![Image](url)\r\n\r\n> Blockquote\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n```code block```\r\n\r\n| Table | Header |\r\n|-------|--------|\r\n| Cell  | Cell   |\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Tools & Resources\r\n\r\n### Editors\r\n\r\n- **VS Code**: Excellent Markdown support with preview\r\n- **Typora**: WYSIWYG Markdown editor\r\n- **Obsidian**: Note-taking with Markdown\r\n- **MarkText**: Free, open-source Markdown editor\r\n\r\n### VS Code Extensions\r\n\r\n- **Markdown All in One**: Shortcuts and preview\r\n- **markdownlint**: Linting and style checking\r\n- **Markdown Preview Enhanced**: Advanced preview features\r\n\r\n### Online Tools\r\n\r\n- **StackEdit**: Browser-based Markdown editor\r\n- **Dillinger**: Online Markdown editor with live preview\r\n- **Markdown Guide**: Comprehensive Markdown reference\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Next Steps\r\n\r\nNow that you understand Markdown and MDX:\r\n\r\n1. **Create Content**: Start writing blog posts with your new skills\r\n2. **Experiment with MDX**: Try the [embed examples](/blog/embed-examples) in your own posts\r\n3. **Check Content Guide**: Review the [Content Collections Guide](/blog/guides/content-collections-guide) for schema details\r\n4. **Read Complete Guide**: See the [Bloomfolio Complete Guide](/blog/guides/bloomfolio-complete-guide) for full setup\r\n\r\nHappy writing! 🌼","src/content/blog/guides/markdown-guide.mdx",[351],"c4a5982d8c80c053","about",["Map",379,381],{"id":379,"data":382,"body":384,"filePath":385,"digest":386,"rendered":387},{"title":309,"photo":383},"/nice.jpg","I'm an aspiring RTL design engineer with a Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Florida.
